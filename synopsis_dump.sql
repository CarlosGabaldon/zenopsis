Their method also creates stem cells that genetically match the donor without having to resort to the controversial step of cloning. If stem cells are used to make replacement cells and tissues for patients, it would be invaluable to have genetically matched cells because they would not be rejected by the immune system. Even more important, scientists say, is that genetically matched cells from patients will enable them to study complex diseases, like Alzheimer’s, in the lab.

They mounted a major campaign to demonize \"MoveOn.org\":http://moveon.org in order to derail the group\'s proven ability to raise funds for antiwar messages and Democratic candidates. During the election year, pro-war Republicans are poised to promote staying the course in Iraq while threatening or even instigating a war on Iran. The Democrats will have to respond with more than an echo.\r\n\r\nBut at this point the leading Democratic contenders are reluctant to say they would pull out all the troops from a war they claim to oppose. In sharp contrast to Republicans, Democrats at least support withdrawing most or all American combat troops on a twelve- to eighteen-month deadline. Asked for exact timelines, however, the top contenders indicate that they would put off the withdrawal of all troops until sometime in their second term. The platform of \"out by 2013\" may be a sufficient difference from the Republicans for some, but it won\'t satisfy the most committed antiwar voters.\r\n\r\nPeace advocates will likely have the best-funded antiwar message in history during the coming election year. Tens of millions of dollars will be raised for voter education and registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns through the 527 committees, which disseminate election messages independent of partisan candidates. The Democrats defaulted on their opportunity to use these independent committees for a peace message in 2004, when they muted and muddled their antiwar position. But this time they will have to contend with the frustration of millions of antiwar voters, and their nominee will be pledged, in rhetoric at least, to end the war.\r\n\r\nThe coming war is a political one, to be fought at home. There will be a yearlong showdown that will determine the presidency and the climate of opinion. If the Republicans succeed in electing the next President, the Iraq War will continue and probably expand. If they lose the presidency, they are already positioning themselves to charge the Democrats with \"losing\" Iraq and ride that theme to a comeback in 2012.','http://www.thenation.com','http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071217/hayden','2007-12-01 09:29:35',NULL,3,6),(7,'Guns Beat Green','www_thenation_com_Guns_Beat_Green','If you are looking for a sure bet in a new growth market, sell solar, buy surveillance; forget wind, buy weapons.\r\n\r\nThe Bush Administration, still roadblocking firm caps on emissions, wants to let the market solve the crisis. \"We\'re on the threshold of dramatic technological breakthroughs,\" Bush assured the world last January, adding, \"We\'ll leave it to the market to decide the mix of fuels that most effectively and efficiently meet this goal.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea that capitalism can save us from climate catastrophe has powerful appeal.

The Self system was a real research tour-de-force, but Self has quite a few fundamental differences from Smalltalk, and the system was not designed for commercial or production use, since it was not very stable and used an enormous amount of memory. But it showed for the first time that pure, dynamically-typed languages like Self and Smalltalk in principle could be gotten much closer to the performance of C.\r\n\r\n*On the East Coast*,  I (Dave Griswold) was frustrated with the fact that there were still a lot of obstacles to using Smalltalk in most kinds of production applications.  The best inlining approach I could come up with without type-feedback was basically a form of a technique the Self group used, customization (copying methods down through inheritance, which means, in this case, that the class can be treated as constant, allowing self-sends to be inlined), but I computed that for the ParcPlace library the best that would do would be to inline about 25% of sends, statically.\r\n\r\n*The two technologies came together*, when I started talking to Urs Hölzle, who had finished the second-generation Self compiler (and his Stanford thesis), and was looking for something interesting to do. After reading his thesis on type-feedback, I realized that the type-feedback technology was actually not as conceptually difficult as most people had thought: people had read all the Self papers and been impressed but terrified of it.

One thing that is special about anarchism is that, unlike all major ideologies, it could never have had a stable and continuous existence on the ground through being in government or a part of a party system. Its history and contemporary characteristics are therefore determined by another factor - cycles of political struggle. As a result, anarchism has a \'generational\' tendency in the sense that you can identify pretty discreet phases of its history according to the period of struggle in which they were shaped. Naturally, as any other attempt at conceptualization, this one is also doomed to be simplified. I hope that, regardless of this, it will be useful for the understanding of this social phenomenon.\r\n\r\nA new model of modern anarchism, which can be discerned today within the new social movement, is the one that insists on widening the anti-authoritarian focus, as well as on deserting the class reductionism. Anarchism can become effective only if it contains three, encompassed, components: worker\'s organizations, activists, and researchers.\r\n\r\n# We are anarchists because we believe that human freedom and happiness would be best guaranteed by a society based on principles of self-organization, voluntary association, and mutual aid, and because we reject all forms of social relations based on systemic violence, such as the state or capitalism.\r\n# We are, however, profoundly anti-sectarian, by which we mean two things:\r\n## we do not attempt to enforce any particular form of anarchism on one other: Platformist, Syndicalist, Primitivist, Insurrectionist or any other. Neither do we wish to exclude anyone on this basis - we value diversity as a principle in itself, limited only by our common rejection of structures of domination such as racism, sexism, fundamentalism, etc.\r\n## since we see anarchism not as a doctrine so much as a process of movement towards a free, just, and sustainable, society, we believe anarchists should not limit themselves to cooperating with those who self-identify as anarchists, but should actively seek to cooperate with anyone who are working to create a world based on those same broad liberatory principles, and, in fact, to learn from them. One of the purposes of the International is to facilitate this: both to make it easier for us to bring some of those millions around the world who are, effectively, anarchists without knowing it, into touch with the thoughts of others who have worked in that same tradition, and, at the same time, to enrich the anarchist tradition itself through contact with their experiences\r\n# We reject all forms of vanguardism and believe that the proper role of the anarchist intellectual (a role that should be open to everyone) is to take part in an ongoing dialogue: to learn from the experience of popular community-building and struggle and offer back the fruits of reflection on that experience not in the spirit of the dictat, but of the gift\r\n# Anyone who accepts these principles is a member of the Anarchist International and everyone who is a member of the Anarchist International is empowered to act as a spokesperson if they so desire. Because we value diversity, we do not expect uniformity of views other than acceptance of the principles themselves (and, of course, acknowledgment that such diversity exists)\r\n# Organization is neither a value in itself nor an evil in itself; the level of organizational structure appropriate to any given project or task can never be dictated in advance but can only be determined by those actually engaged in it. So with any project initiated within the International: it should be up to those undertaking it to determine the form and level of organization appropriate for that project.
