<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
At Zenopsis.com. ("Zenopsis.com", "we," or "us"), we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our users. 
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how personal information is collected from users of the 
Zenopsis.com's Web site located at www.Zenopsis.com ("Site"), and how that information is used 
and disclosed. By using our Site, you consent to the terms of this Policy.
</p>
<h3>What is Personal Information?</h3>
<p>
Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as a user's name, 
address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number, and information about 
that individual's activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her 
purchases or use of services. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date 
of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal 
information that identifies you.
</p>
<p>
Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect 
about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been 
removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information 
about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data.
</p>
<h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit our Site or use the various 
services and activities available on our Site. For example, you provide us with personal information

When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet 
Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type and the time and date of your visit. This information 
is collected through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by a Web 
site to give you a unique identification. We also use cookies on our Site to keep track of services you have

<p>
Additionally, we use, and allow third parties to use, Web beacons on the Site to monitor the effectiveness

email has be read. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the

behalf. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, Web beacons or other technology to collect non-personally 
identifiable information about your visits to our Site in order to use it to present advertisements that may be 
of interest to you.
</p>
<h3>How We Use the Information We Collect</h3>

Disclosure of Information
</p>
<p>
We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited 
circumstances described in this Policy. We share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing 
internal functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, for example, analyzing data, providing 
marketing assistance and processing payment transactions. In all cases we limit the information shared with our third-party

these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.

fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate 
danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure 
of records without delay.
</p>
<p>
In addition, information about our users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, 
acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in
